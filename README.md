# Drowsiness Detection System

This repository contains a **Alertness-Detection-System** built using Python, OpenCV, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system monitors a person’s eyes via a webcam and detects signs of drowsiness by classifying the state of the eyes (open or closed). If the system identifies drowsiness based on a threshold score, it triggers an alert to help prevent accidents or hazardous situations.

## Project Overview

Alertness-Detection is crucial in scenarios like driving, where a lack of alertness can lead to serious accidents. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to determine whether a person’s eyes are open or closed. By continuously monitoring the state of the eyes, the system calculates a score to indicate the person’s drowsiness level. This project can be integrated into safety applications to reduce incidents caused by fatigue.

## System Workflow

The system follows these steps to detect drowsiness:

1. **Capture Image**: Obtain real-time images from the webcam.
2. **Face Detection**: Identify and create a Region of Interest (ROI) around the face.
3. **Eye Detection**: Detect the eyes within the ROI and feed them into the classifier.
4. **Classification**: The classifier categorizes the eyes as either open or closed.
5. **Drowsiness Score Calculation**: Based on consecutive frames, a score is calculated to determine if the person is drowsy.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using Keras with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are effective for image classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. This model architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - Layer 1: 32 nodes, kernel size 3
  - Layer 2: 32 nodes, kernel size 3
  - Layer 3: 64 nodes, kernel size 3
- **Fully Connected Layer**: 128 nodes
- **Output Layer**: Classifies the eye state as open or closed.

## Project Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a webcam for capturing real-time images. Install Python (version 3.6 recommended) and use pip to install the required packages:

1. **OpenCV** - For face and eye detection:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. **TensorFlow** - The backend for Keras:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Keras** - To build and train the CNN model:
   ```bash
   pip install keras
   ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Drowsiness-Detection-System.git
   cd Drowsiness-Detection-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary libraries if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the System**:

   Run the Python script to start the drowsiness detection system:

   ```bash
   python drowsiness_detection.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start Webcam**: The script automatically activates the webcam and begins capturing frames.
2. **Drowsiness Detection**: The model processes the frames, detects the eyes, and classifies their state.
3. **Alert System**: When the score exceeds a certain threshold indicating drowsiness, an alert can be triggered (e.g., sound alarm).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the application.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks like face and eye detection.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Alert System**: Implement an audio alarm or haptic feedback for real-world scenarios.
- **Multimodal Detection**: Combine eye tracking with other indicators like head position or yawning detection.
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Optimize model performance for real-time applications on low-power devices.
